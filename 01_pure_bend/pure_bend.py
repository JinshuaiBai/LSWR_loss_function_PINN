    This code is for the pure bending beam problem in "A Noval Way to Formulate the Loss Function 
    in Physics-Informed Neural Network for Solid Mechanics". DOI: 
    
    A pure bending beam is modeled here. The length and height of the beam are L = 1 m and H = 0.1 m. 
    The beam is bent by a moment M = 1/12 Nâˆ™m subjected on both sides of the beam. Due to the 
    geometric symmetry, only half of the beam is considered. To implement the moment M, we apply 
    a linear distributed force on the side of the beam, F(y) = 1000y N/m^2. The sample points are 
    uniformly distributed in the computational domain with 0.01 m intervals in all directions. We
    use two FNNs with the same structures to respectively predict the displacement field u and v.
    The Young's module E = 1000 Pa and the Poisson ratio is 0.3.
    
    This code is developed by @Jinshuai Bai and @Yuantong Gu. For more details, please contact:
